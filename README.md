### MiniFacebook 

This project was developed as part of the Secure Application Development course during the Spring 2025 semester. It is a basic social media-style web application that allows users to:

- Create an account and log in

- Post text-based content

- Comment on other users' posts

- Interact with a dynamic, database-backed interface

The focus of the project was to implement secure coding practices throughout the application, including input validation, user authentication, and session management.
